# 🚀 GA4 Quick Start - See Your Events NOW!

## ✅ Application Running

Your app is live at: **http://localhost:5001**

## 📊 See Events in Google Analytics (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Open Google Analytics Real-time (30 seconds)

1. Go to: **https://analytics.google.com**
2. Click **Reports** (left sidebar)
3. Click **Realtime** (or **Real-time**)

**That's it!** You're now viewing live events.

### Step 2: Test the Application (1 minute)

1. **Open your app**: http://localhost:5001
2. **Wait 10-30 seconds** → You should see "1 active user" in GA Real-time
3. **Enter a URL**: `https://docs.anthropic.com`
4. **Click**: "Generate llms.txt (Summary)"
5. **Watch GA Real-time** → You'll see events appear:
   - `llms_generation_started`
   - `llms_generation_success` (after ~10-30 seconds)
6. **Click Download** → You'll see `file_download` event

### Step 3: View Event Details

In the Real-time dashboard, you'll see:

```
Event count by Event name
├─ page_view (automatic)
├─ llms_generation_started
├─ llms_generation_success
└─ file_download
```

Click on any event name to see detailed parameters!

## 🔍 Alternative: Browser DevTools (Instant Verification)

**Fastest way to verify events are working:**

1. **Open DevTools**: Press `F12`
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Filter**: Type `google-analytics.com` in the filter box
4. **Use the app**: Generate llms.txt
5. **See requests**: Each action sends a request to GA
   - Status 200 = ✅ Event sent successfully!
