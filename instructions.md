Automated llms.txt Generator

Objective
Develop a tool that automatically generates an llms.txt file for a given website by analyzing
its structure and content. Additionally, implement a mechanism to keep the llms.txt file
updated as the website evolves.
Background
The llms.txt file is a proposed standard designed to help Large Language Models (LLMs)
better understand and interact with website content. Similar to robots.txt, which guides
search engine crawlers, llms.txt provides structured information tailored for AI systems,
enhancing their ability to process and utilize web data effectively.
Assignment Tasks
Create a tool, application, or SDK that covers the following components:
1. Website Analysis and Content Extraction:
○ Develop a crawler that traverses the website to identify key pages and extract
relevant metadata, such as titles, descriptions, and URLs.

2. llms.txt File Generation:
○ Structure the extracted data into the llms.txt format, adhering to the standard
specifications.
3. Automated Updates:
○ Implement a monitoring system that detects changes in the website's structure or
content and updates the llms.txt file accordingly.

4. Documentation:
○ Provide clear instructions on how to set up, configure, and use the tool.
It is up to you to design how the user interacts with this tool. You can choose to build a web
application the user directly visits to create the llms.txt, or you might consider an SDK that could
be used in popular development frameworks/tools such as Next.js/Vercel.

Evaluation Criteria
● Functionality: The tool should accurately generate an llms.txt file that reflects the
website's structure and content.

● Automation: The update mechanism should effectively detect changes and refresh the
llms.txt file without manual intervention.
● Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
● Documentation: Clear and comprehensive documentation should accompany the tool,
facilitating easy setup and usage.
